MJ here. I am tackling several web developer courses including finishing the first session of Grow with Google. I hope I get chosen for the second half as I was laid-off two days ago. I am also completing the front-end development piece with freecodecamp and a boot camp on Udemy with Colt Steele. I plan to upload the website I developed last fall when I was taking a course through UC Davis. I recently added a javascript slide show. You can see it at laithaimichigan.com
